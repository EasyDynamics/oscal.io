        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) as a standardized, data-centric framework
          that can be applied to an information system for documenting and assessing its security controls. Today, security
          controls and control baselines are represented in proprietary formats, requiring data conversion and manual effort
          to describe their implementation. An important goal of OSCAL is to move the security controls and control baselines
          from a text-based and manual approach (using word processors or spreadsheets) to a set of standardized and
          machine-readable formats. With systems security information represented in OSCAL, security professionals will be
          able to automate security assessment, auditing, and continuous monitoring processes.
        </p>

        <h3>Why OSCAL?</h3>
        <p>
        There are a number of complicating factors contributing to the challenges faced by information system security professionals today.
        </p>
        <ul class="text-list">
          <li>Multiple regulatory standards and frameworks, which change over time;</li>
          <li>Regulatory standards and frameworks overlap in scope and can often conflict or be difficult to manage together; and</li>
          <li>Information systems are increasing in size and complexity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        To address information security and privacy risks, the implementation of selected controls needs to be verified and shown to be effective. To provide assurance of a system's security and privacy posture, the control implementation of a system must be both correctly described, assessed, and authorized. These tasks are resource-intensive, and often challenging to perform within budget constraints given the complexity of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        The standardized formats provided by the OSCAL project help to streamline and standardize the processes of documenting, implementing and assessing security controls. The automation enabled by the OSCAL formats will reduce complexity, decrease implementation costs, and enable the simultaneous, continuous assessment of a system's security against multiple sets of requirements. Additionally, paperwork will be significantly reduced.
