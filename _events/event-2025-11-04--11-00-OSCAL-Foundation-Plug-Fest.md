The OSCAL Foundation is excited to announce our upcoming OSCAL Plugfest taking place in-person on November 4, 2025 at Venable LLP’s Offices at 600 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC.

This hands-on event will bring together OSCAL users, vendors, and the broader community to collaborate on real-world technical challenges and workstreams. Participants will roll up their sleeves to tackle focused problems, share expertise, and advance the OSCAL ecosystem.

The morning session will include a hackathon, where we invite technical experts to bring their OSCAL tools and content for a collaborative testing and interoperability workshop. One featured workstream will explore the OSCAL Mapping Model and the recent official changes to the NIST specification that the OSCAL Foundation pioneered.

In addition to the hackathon, the afternoon session will feature presentations and discussions highlighting OSCAL’s role as both a technical standard and a practical solution for government and private sector challenges moving forward.

Mark your calendars for November 4, 2025, in Washington, DC.

More details, including registration and agenda, will follow soon.

We look forward to seeing you there and working together to drive OSCAL forward!
