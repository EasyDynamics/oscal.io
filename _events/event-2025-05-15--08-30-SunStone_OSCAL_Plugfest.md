Debugging and interoperability event to improve tool compatibility.
Forum for agencies, 3PAOs and enterprises to observe and assess OSCAL in action.
Leave with practical checklists, developer tips and design guidance on how to use OSCAL tools or as developers to implement OSCAL in your tooling/products.

### What is a PlugFest Anyway?

The technical goal is twofold: check compliance to the standard, and test the effectiveness of the standard."  --Wikipedia

The goal is to test and explore compatibility and conformity across OSCAL-enabled tools and use cases.  Those who can generate OSCAL SSPs and other model artifacts will test with other implementations, with the objective to identify inconsistencies and to improve interoperability in real world use cases.
